# Info screen
Free digital signage software. This project will allow you to register an account, login, edit your own account, create new users, manage slides and messages to be displayed on the info screen. 

New slides and messages are automatically obtained every 60 seconds.

## Getting up and running
1. Run database.sql to setup database, tables and dummy data
2. Edit common.php and input your mysql username, password, host and database name

## Work in progress
This is just a proof of concept for information screens to present to my director at work, there may be security issues, bugs etc...
